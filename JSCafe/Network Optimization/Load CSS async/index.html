    -> critical.css is important for website, other two are not that imp even if they are downloaded later.
    nonCritical, style, critical -> order of fetching the files in network tab and rendering will be blocked
    (coz by-default css is render blocking source i.e. browser wont render any processed content until CSSOM is constructed)

    -> larger the css, larger fetch time, large render blocking period. Hence it is adviced to divide css into multiple css files and
    keep critical content in one separate file.
