<!-- 
    Preload
    Suppose style2.css and script2.js are high priority assets i.e. according to our business requirement we want these assets to be downloaded as soon as browser is downloading assets.
    Browser will preload assets with rel="preload"(download and keep them in memory), but it wont execute the file. Execution will only start when we consume these files(script tag for js and link tag for css).
-->

<!-- 
    Prefetch
    Should be applied to assets that will definately get loaded on some user action i.e. we are sure that user will navigate to that worflow that loads these assets.
    Priority of these assests will be lowest because these are going to load on some other page loads.
-->

<!-- 
    Preconnect
    Suppose we are loading assets from some other domain in our application. The connection bw our domain and the other domain will take some time(handshaking).
    To avoid this delay in handshaking on actual load of asset, we can do preconnect(or handshake).
    NOTE : Handshake happens only once bw domains.
